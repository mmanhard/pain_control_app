# Pain Control (Front-End)

Pain control is a web application that gives users the ability to track their
pain levels over time and better understand how they feel on a regular basis.

Please note: this is the source code for the front-end. The source code for the
back end can be found [here!](https://github.com/mmanhard/pain_control_backend)
